# Philosophy & Principles of SRS

## Principles

* Learning precedes memorization.
* SRS is for hierarchies of knowledge as well as trivia.
* The interest (and therefore memorability) of any question depends on its relation to greater questions of intrinsic interest.

## Definitions and Concepts

### Orphan Question
A question with no relation to any other.

### Waste
* Memorizing the phrasing of an answer.
* Associating the card's question with its answer based on the wording and length of the question, not its meaning. (More generally: memorizing syntax not semantics)
* Loading a subject into memory. (This is the justification of a compound question. If the two pieces of information are very closely related this loading is only done once.
* Debugging and optimizing vinca.
### Two types of Memory
* Active: the knowledge will be recalled upon demand with the proper cue.
* Passive: I am aware that there is an answer, but I must consult a reference.




## Rules of Thumb

* Never create fewer than six cards at a time. A piece of trivia which seems interesting now will be an orphan question within a year. TODO: examples of orphan questions I have removed from my own collection.
* Always hint the form of the answer. E.g. if the question is asking for a country, end the question with [country]. TODO: examples of hinting the answer.
* Write your own questions. Make your own diagrams.
* Do not try to separate questions of different disciplines.


## Metaphors

### Redundancy
By use of a polynomial, five pieces of data may be redundated into six such that even if one piece is then lost, the remaining five are sufficient to recover the original.
