# Philosophy & Principles of SRS

## Principles

* Learning precedes memorization.
* SRS is for hierarchies of knowledge as well as trivia.
* The interest (and therefore memorability) of any question depends on its relation to greater questions of intrinsic interest.

## Definitions and Concepts

### Orphan Question
A question with no relation to any other.

### Waste
* Memorizing the phrasing of an answer.
* Associating the card's question with its answer based on the wording and length of the question, not its meaning. (More generally: memorizing syntax not semantics)
* Loading a subject into memory. (This is the justification of a compound question. If the two pieces of information are very closely related this loading is only done once.
* Debugging and optimizing vinca.
### Two types of Memory
* Active: the knowledge will be recalled upon demand with the proper cue.
* Passive: I am aware that there is an answer, but I must consult a reference.




## Rules of Thumb

* Never create fewer than six cards at a time. A piece of trivia which seems interesting now will be an orphan question within a year. TODO: examples of orphan questions I have removed from my own collection.
* Always hint the form of the answer. E.g. if the question is asking for a country, end the question with [country]. TODO: examples of hinting the answer.
* Write your own questions. Make your own diagrams.
* Do not try to separate questions of different disciplines.


## Metaphors

### Redundancy
By use of a polynomial, five pieces of data may be redundated into six such that even if one piece is then lost, the remaining five are sufficient to recover the original.

Misc. Philosophy 
----------------
2 types of memory in vinca: recall ability; known to exist
Definition of waste: all learning of card order, phrasing, etc.
Defense of the compound question:
- the time to load the subject into memory is non-zero, but of zero value
- a compound question reviews two pieces of material and this loading is only done once.
principle: the questions should be unambiguous for someone who did not create them

The idea of a network of facts
The inner ones are safe (how can I forget that Constantine called the council of Nice if I know it was called in 325 and that he entered it with humilit?)
The outer ones are exposed and must form an adamantine phalanx. (Strong "surface tension"; the surface tension of knowledge)
Vinca protects the frontiers.

idea of polynomial data retrieval: 4 pieces of information are split into 5 cards; I can forget any card and the other 4 can recover it. (This is the generalization of redundancy.)

impractical:
intelligence is not in fact but relation
vinca is not for trivia, but hierarchy
therefore extensively label the relations between cards.
Not just tags, but atomic single and double bonds between pairs of cards
superior & inferior cards. in short, a whole web
Perhaps special cards would be 'relation cards' which ask about the connect of a pair of pieces of knowledge.
An interactive traversal program would then allow me to move from card to card and navigate the web interactively.
It would visualize concentric circles of knowledge.
And when you have made 100,000 such cards, traversing this web would be very similar to traversing your own brain.
(it would be useful for any writing too. cards could be rated for many things like their importance, or in this
case for their literary potential.)
