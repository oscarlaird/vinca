Six priorities
--------------
1. Improve Vim-Editor (currently it breaks on 'w')
        - probably everything would be more reliable if we got rid of regex
        - come up with a sane functional approach to structuring motions and operators
        - unit test these functions
6. Statistics
        - intelligent review count forecast

Low goals
---------
- leaches
- subscript letters
- figure out how to smooth out card due dates (maybe unncecessary)
- sibling cards.
- special schedulers for quotations, languages, &c.
- postpone should change relative to due-date or today (whichever is later)
